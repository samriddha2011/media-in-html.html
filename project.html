        <h1>Imagining Teaching and Learning</h1>
        <h3>Why we exist?</h3>
        <P>Teaching process has stayed the same for decades. The traditional teaching and offline education system are plagued with
        multiple inefficiencies.
        Our vision at Vedantu is to reimagine and evolve the way teaching and learning have been happening for decades. By
        combining quality teachers, engaging content and superior technology we are able to create a superior learning
        experience for students and aid in their outcome improvement, which is unlike any offline experience.
        Teaching and learning are set to transform at a rapid pace and our mission at Vedantu is to accelerate these
        transformations.
        
        Even our name 'Vedantu' bears a testimony to our purpose.
        Veda = 'Knowledge' and Tantu= 'Network'.
        A knowledge network where any student can tap into a teacher directly and learning can happen in a personalized way,
        anytime-anywhere.
